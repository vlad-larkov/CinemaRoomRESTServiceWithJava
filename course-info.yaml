summary: "<div><div class=\"alert alert-primary\">You will practice concepts frequently\
  \ tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</div>\r\n<p>Always wanted\
  \ to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can\
  \ buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets?\
  \ The idea of a ticket booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service\
  \ for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available\
  \ seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass\
  \ me the popcorn, please!</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/189?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
